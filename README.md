# 🛡️ Hybrid URL Threat Detection System using Deep Learning and ONNX

A Hybrid Deep Learning-based URL Threat Detection System that classifies URLs into **Benign**, **Phishing**, **Piracy**, and **Typosquatting** using handcrafted URL features, semantic embeddings, and a BiLSTM neural network. The trained model is exported to ONNX format and deployed using FastAPI for efficient inference.

---

## 📖 Overview

With the rapid growth of cyber threats, malicious URLs have become one of the primary attack vectors used for phishing, piracy, and typosquatting attacks. This project presents a Hybrid Deep Learning approach that combines handcrafted lexical URL features, semantic embeddings generated using MiniLM, and a BiLSTM model to accurately classify URLs into multiple threat categories.

The model is trained in **Google Colab**, converted into **ONNX** format for optimized inference, and deployed as a **FastAPI** application.
